three react concepts
1) Props : allow you to pass data into your components
2) functional components: an alternative, and more intuitive approach to creating
    React components
3) Controlled components: Allow you to hook up the forms in your
    application to your component state


the way to build a large react application is by building a bunch
of smaller React components and then composing them together

Basic user functiona 
to fetch specific user by adding a parameter 
to our function definition and by passing in the user name 
when the function is invoked

function fetchUser(username) {
    //ajax call
}

fetchUser('john')

<user />
here above we have a very basic React Component whos whole purpus
is to display a user to the UI
 we need a way to pass the user component a username , so to know which user to display to the view
 to do that we can add a custom attribute to our component and give it a value
 <user username='John' />
 Now, we can access that value from the inside of our component definition
 by using this.props.username 
in fact any attribute that are added to a component will be
accessible on the prop's object from inside of that component
 class User extents React.Component {
     render(){
         return (
            <div>
                <p> Username: {this.props.username} </p>
                <p> Is Friend?: {this.props.friend}</p>
             </div>
         )
     }
 }

 <User username='John' friend={true}/>

 ///////////////
 we will make our first components , going to recive these contacts and 
 going to display those to our view, we can have state living instead of
 our app file
 but all we have to do just like we would pass an argument to a function,
 we can pass these contacts to our new component that we r goung to create

 make a new file 'src/ListContacts.js' its a component which list our contacts

 import React, {Component} from 'react'

//the point of this ContactList compenent is to map over each of 
these contacts and for each one its going to display a specific contact
to the view
we need to do 2 things:
1) we need to render our lists contacts components
2) when render it we need to make sure that we pass it this contact's array

so lets import our list contacts component
 class ListContacts extends Component {
    //the only property on our component class that we alwayse have to specift  
    render(){
        return (

            //specift the specific UI for this component
            //return an ordered list
            <ol className='contact-list'>
            
            </ol>
        )
    }
 }

 export default ListContacts
